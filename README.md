This is a simple app; no configuration needed :)

Here's what it currently looks like:

![A screenshot of a website. Buttons for multiple languages span the top of the page, and the rest of the page is split vertically: the left half is code with line numbers and the code is colored. The right side is a list of concepts, with buttons at the top of the list to presumably switch out lists. One of the current list items is highlighted in bright green, and code illuminating that concept within the code is highlighted in the same color to draw the eye. There is also a color theme switch button in the top right to enter "bright mode" instead of the current default "dark mode".](screenshotSept42024.png "Screengrab")

The bare bones of and inspiration for this code was from the unknown contributor of [this site](https://programming-vocab.netlify.app/).
